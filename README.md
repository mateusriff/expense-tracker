# More about this project

This application simulates an expense tracker. You can pick a year from 2020 to 2022 and check the expenses by item, amount and date. You can also add new expenses by filling out the form. A chart displays the expenses by month. 

This React application was made as part of a React course to practice a few things, such as:
- Hooks (useState)
- Props
- Methods (map and filter)
- Conditional rendering
